            <p class="blog-text-header">
                It is an appliance that is designed with a motor and blades that rotate to help keep a room cool. The
                fans
                are set up on the ceiling where they can move the air around and reduce the heat in a particular space.
                Although the ceiling fan may be considered a tad outdated compared to the cooling technology that
                homeowners
                have today, it remains a useful device. The ability of ceiling fans to achieve a cooling effect without
                consuming a lot of power is what keeps them relevant. Ceiling fans are available in a wide range that
                this
                review will look at in a bid to narrow down the best options for users.

                        Ceiling fans look like simple designs from the outside, but a lot goes on to achieve the cooling
                        effect. One vital element to point out in this review is that ceiling fans don’t actually cool
                        the air, meaning that they don’t do anything to change the temperature of the air.

                        Ceiling fans go back a long way. They can be traced to 500 BC India where punkah fans were used
                        to move the air around to cool it. The rotary fan made its first appearance in the 1860s where a
                        water-run turbine was responsible for turning the blades. This model of the ceiling fan gained
                        popularity because it could house several fan units. Commercial spaces such as restaurants,
                        stores and offices invested in it.

                        Before hanging a fan, it helps to know if your purchase was the best. Test the ease of the
                        appliance. Look at the instructions for setting up the fan, how to switch it on and to control
                        the other features. How fast can you adjust the fan from summer to winter mode? If the fan will
                        be running all year, then you want assurances that anyone can operate it without too much
                        trouble.

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Also called low-profile, this ceiling fan is built for low ceilings. Hugger fans are best used
                        on ceilings that are less than 8 feet from the floor. The fans are designed to mount flush on
                        the ceiling directly on the bracket. This installation ensures that the fan clears the mandatory
                        distance of 7 feet from the floor. A low-profile fan would also be the best choice for a vaulted
                        ceiling. A ceiling adapter may be necessary to angle the fan appropriately.
